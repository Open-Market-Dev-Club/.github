## About
Gosti Network is a next-gen decentralized content distribution network currently in development.

Our Goal is to replace centralized digital content marketplaces like Steam with a decentralized system that is free and permissionless for content publishers, and provides a truly open and peer-to-peer software ecosystem for all of our users.

Gosti is built from the ground up to protect and promote the rights of consumers to own the products they buy, and to enable truly open markets free from middlemen.

## Contribution
We need contributers! If you are interested in our mission, and want to support the development of Gosti Network, please get in touch. We are an extremely small team, with an absurdly huge goal. We need all the help we can get in terms of manpower, marketing, and of course financial support.
